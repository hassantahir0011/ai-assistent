                            available herein (collectively, the “Service”). </p>
                        <p>These terms of service govern your access to and use of the Service (“Terms of Service”).
                            The Terms of Service shall be deemed to include all other operating rules, policies and procedures that are
                            referred to herein or that may otherwise be published by {{ config('app.name') }} from time to time (collectively,
                            “Policies”), including without limitation, the following:</p>

                        <p><em>If you do not agree to all of the terms of service, or if you are

                                any part of the service. Using all or any part of the service will constitute acceptance and create a

                        <p>User agrees, in connection with any use of the Service: (a) to release {{ config('app.name') }} (and its
                            licensors and suppliers) from any and all claims, demands, damages and liabilities, of any type and nature,

                            settlement amounts or damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees)
                            awarded and arising out of such a claim. {{ config('app.name') }} reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and
                            control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by User, in which event User will assist and
                            cooperate with {{ config('app.name') }} in asserting any available defenses.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>{{ config('app.name') }} makes no representation that the Service is appropriate or legally available for
                            use in locations outside the United States, and accessing and using the Service is prohibited from
                            territories where doing so would be illegal. Users that access the Service from other locations do so at
                            their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws.</p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>13. Disputes; Choice of Law and Forum</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>User and {{ config('app.name') }} agree that any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to the
                            Service must commence within three (3) months after the claim or cause of action arose; otherwise, such cause of
                            action is permanently barred.</p>
                        <p>The Terms of Service shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
                            State of Michigan, excluding its conflicts of law rules, and the United States of America. In the event of
                            any conflict between US and foreign laws, rules and regulations, US laws, rules and regulations shall
                            govern. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to
                            the Terms of Service. User expressly agrees that the exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or action arising
                            out of or relating to the Terms of Service or use of the Site or Service shall be in the state of New York,
                            USA, and User further agrees and submits to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of such courts for the
                            purpose of litigating any such claim or action. Use of the Service is not authorized in any jurisdiction
                            that does not give effect to all provisions of the Terms of Service, including without limitation, this
                            section.</p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>14. Integration and Severability</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>The Terms of Service (including the Policies) are the entire agreement between User and
                            {{ config('app.name') }} with respect to access, use and operation of the Service, and supersede all prior or
                            contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between User and
                            {{ config('app.name') }} with respect to the Service. If any provision of the Terms of Service is found to be
                            unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so
                            that the Terms of Service will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.</p>
                    </div>
